//TODO implement a simple but also cool to do list adder from CLI into an array then push that array back out to the terminal with a cool terminal Interface.  
// start with the import statements  
require('../Functions'); // had to install npm i --save-dev @types/node 

// imported the functions folder so it should use all the files inside that function folder. 
// we can call in the main the entire set of functions in order to start the program off.
